# Tips on Variables
1. Var does not give you errors as it is outdated. You should not use the variable before initializing it. 

2. Use `let` instead. `let` does not allow a variable to beused before initializing which is better for the code integrity.

3. To whipe out the value of a certain variable, make it equals null

```javascript
      let variable = 55;
      variable = null;
      console.log(variable);
```
4. An Undefined variable is variable that was declared but not initialized
