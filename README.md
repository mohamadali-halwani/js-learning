# js-learning
#### The code I wrote while learning JavaScript. I learned JavaScript from some tutorials on Pluralsight, udemy, and Youtube. I am uploading the files here to keep and review with ease to my personal needs.
#### I'll be organizing the code into a good tutorial for public use as I learn.
#### As I'm writing, I suppose you are already familiar with HTML and basic programming fundamentals.
