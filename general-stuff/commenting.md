# Commenting
### To write a comment on one line, you simply use double forward slashes //


``` //Some sort of code to test```
``` //Some sort of blabbery to test```
``` //Some sort of stuff to test```
``` //Some sort of talk to test```
``` //Some sort of text to test```


### To make a comment on multiple lines, you open with /* and close with */

``` /* As you can see, this chunk of text is marked as a comment thanks to the opening and closing symbols in javascript */```
