# Commenting
### To write a comment on one line, you simply use double forward slashes //


``` 
//Some sort of code to test 
function showMessage(message){
    document.getElementById('message').textContent= message;
}

//Some sort of blabbery to test
function showMessage(message){
    document.getElementById('message').textContent= message;
}

//Some sort of stuff to test
function showMessage(message){
    document.getElementById('message').textContent= message;
}

//Some sort of talk to test
function showMessage(message){
    document.getElementById('message').textContent= message;
}
//Some sort of text to test
```
### To make a comment on multiple lines, you open with /* and close with */

```
/* As you can see, this chunk of text is marked as a comment thanks to the opening and closing 
symbols in javascript. You can keep writing until you break the first line and the text will 
still be considered a comment, pretty cool huh? */

```
